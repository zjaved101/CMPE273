# Consistent Hashing and RHW Hashing

The distributed cache you implemented in the midterm is based on naive modula hashing to shard the data.

## Part I.

Implement Rendezvous hashing to shard the data.


## Part II.

Implement consistent hashing to shard the data.

Features:

* Add virtual node layer in the consistent hashing.
* Implement virtual node with data replication.
